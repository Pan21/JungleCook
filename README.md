view commonly viewed recipes without the need to log in and out.

Users also have the ablilty to log in and out to store personal Recipes that are
not viewable to others who use the site as well.

This site used Content injection to allow for rapid page changes with minimal loading time and
Not needlessly loading excess data such as the Nav or footer.
